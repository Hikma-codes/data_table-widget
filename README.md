Flutter DataTable Widget Demo

Overview

I have made a Flutter demo for the DataTable widget that I showed in class on February 12 2026. This DataTable widget is really cool. The DataTable widget can be used to show data in my app.

The DataTable widget is used to display data about stress percentages of students throughout the week. My app is an example of how to use the DataTable widget to show this kind of data. The DataTable widget is very useful, for this purpose. I have a demo made with Flutter. It has two tables that I use with the DataTable widget. The first table for the DataTable widget is about weeks 1 to 6. This table shows my stress levels. The other table for the DataTable widget is about weeks 7 to 11. This table for the DataTable widget shows what my stress levels might be like later, in the semester.

The main idea of this project was to show people how the DataTable thing works in Flutter. The DataTable is used to make tables that're easy to read. We have a table where each student gets their line and each week is a separate column. I made the cells in the DataTable colors to show how stressed the students are. The colors in the DataTable work like this:

* green means the students are not very stressed

* yellow means the students are stressed

* orange means the students are pretty stressed

* red means the students are very stressed. I used the DataTable to make it clear how the students are doing. The DataTable is a way to show information, about the students. The DataTable is really helpful. It makes things clear so people do not have to look at every number. This makes it a lot easier to see what is going on with the students. The DataTable shows what is happening with the students and their stress levels. The DataTable is very useful, for understanding the students and their stress levels.

Features

When we talk about scrolling the tables are actually wrapped in special scrollable things. This is so all the information can fit on screens. We use vertical scrolling for this. Vertical scrolling is really helpful because it lets us see all the information, on screens.

The stress levels are shown with colors.

Each little box is a color depending on the stress levels.

When the stress levels go up or down the color of the box changes.

This makes it really easy to see what is happening with the stress levels over time.

You can see the stress levels and the colors help you notice patterns, in the stress levels.

The stress levels are what you are trying to understand. The colors are a big help.

I also added a reusable table builder. The reusable table builder uses a function to make tables. This special function is called buildTable. The buildTable function makes tables by itself. It uses the information from the dataset and the starting week that I tell it to use.

The reusable table builder and the buildTable function are really helpful. The buildTable function makes tables for me when I need them. It does this using the dataset and the starting week. I give the function the dataset and the starting week and it makes a table. The reusable table builder is very useful because it has the function.

The Structured UI is made to look nice and clean. Each table has some space, around it. It has shadows and rounded corners. This makes the Structured UI tables look neat and easy to see. The Structured UI tables are separated from each other so they do not look messy. This is what makes the Structured UI look so clean because the Structured UI tables are well organized.

Key Widget: DataTable

The DataTable widget is really important, in this demo. I remember talking about the DataTable widget when I gave my presentation. The DataTable widget is what I was trying to explain to everyone.

We use columns to define the headers in a table. For example in the demo I made I created one column for the Name. Then I went ahead. Added more columns, one for each week. I was able to do this dynamically, which was really useful. I added columns for each week. The table could grow as needed with a column, for each week.

The rows are like lines that have information about each student.

Each row is for one student.

The weekly stress percentages for that student are shown in boxes or cells in that students row.

The students stress levels for the week are displayed in these cells of the students row.

The students stress levels, for the week are what you see in the cells of each students row.

The color of the heading row is something that you can change. This will change the background color of the header row. I used Colors.teal for the header row color because it looks really good against the white table cells. The Colors.teal gives a contrast to the white table cells. I think Colors.teal is a choice, for the header row color because it makes the header row stand out from the white table cells.

These three things teach us how to control the structure the content and the way a table looks in Flutter. We can use these attributes to change the structure of a table in Flutter. We can also use them to change the content of a table in Flutter.. We can even use these attributes to change the styling of a table in Flutter. The table, in Flutter can be made to look really different using these attributes.

How to Run

To see this demo on your own machine or device:

Clone the repository:

git clone <https://github.com/Hikma-codes/data_table-widget.git>

Navigate to the project folder:

cd flutter-data-table-demo

Get dependencies:

To get the packages for your Flutter project you need to do something. You need to run the command flutter pub get. This command does an important job. It gets all the packages that your Flutter project is using.

When you run this command flutter pub get it will download all the required packages for your Flutter project. The Flutter project will then have everything it needs. You have to run flutter pub get to get all these packages, for your Flutter project.

To get started with your Flutter project you need to do a things. First you should open the terminal. Go to the root of your Flutter project. This is where the pubspec.yaml file is. Then you should run Flutter pub get in the terminal.

After you do that you can start building your Flutter project. Running Flutter pub get is a step, for your Flutter project.

When you make changes to the pubspec.yaml file you need to run flutter pub get so your Flutter project can get the packages. You should do this every time you make changes to the pubspec.yaml file. This way your Flutter project will have the packages it needs.

Run the app on a connected device or emulator:

To get the Flutter application going you have to type this command: flutter run. You do this in the terminal.

When you type the command the Flutter application will start up.

You will see the Flutter application up. Running on a device or maybe an emulator.

The command you use to get the Flutter application running is flutter run. You use this command to run the Flutter application.

You will see two tables. These tables show you the stress levels for weeks 1 to 6 and weeks 7 to 11. The stress levels in these tables are shown with colors. This means that the stress percentages for weeks 1 to 6 and weeks 7 to 11 are color coded. The tables, for weeks 1 to 6 and weeks 7 to 11 have stress percentages that're easy to see because they are color coded.

Example Screenshot

This is what the app looks like. You should put your picture of the app. The app has a design. This is the place to show what the app looks like.

The app is something that people will see so you need to show what the app looks like.

You can put a picture of the app in this spot to show people what the app looks like.

Notes on Attributes

When I was giving my presentation I showed the people watching three things that the DataTable widget can do:

The columns part is really important because it decides how many headers are in the table. It also decides what the labels on these headers say. This is what helps people understand what they are looking at.

The columns setting is where you can make changes to the number of headers and the labels on the columns. You can change the labels on the columns to say what you want. The columns setting is very useful, for this.

The rows setting is really important because it decides what information you see in each line of the table.

It is what makes sure you get the information in each line.

The rows setting controls the information that is shown in each line of the table.

This setting is what determines what you see in the table one line, at a time. That is the rows setting.

The headingRowColor is a thing that changes the color behind the table header row. This makes the table easier to read. It looks better this way.

The headingRowColor is really about making the table look better.

It is, about improving the way the table looks and that is what the headingRowColor does to the table.

The DataTable widget has some attributes that make a difference, in how the table looks on the screen.

It also affects how the DataTable widget works.

This is what makes the DataTable widget so flexible.

The DataTable widget looks really good on the screen.

The DataTable widget is very flexible. It looks nice.

The attributes of the DataTable widget are what make it look very nice.

I think the DataTable widget is great because of this.

The DataTable widget is flexible. It looks good on the screen because of its attributes.
